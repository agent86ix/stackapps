<h2>agent86's Stack Exchange tools</h2>

<p>What follows is a quick listing of the tools I host here.  When they are completed, my apps are listed on
 StackApps.  You can browse my submitted app list <a href="http://stackapps.com/search?q=%5Bapp%5D+user%3A9073">here, </a>
 or my submitted scripts <a href="http://stackapps.com/search?q=%5Bscript%5D+user%3A9073">here.</a></p>
 
<p>Do note that most of my apps use the Stack Exchange API, and therefore <b>you may be asked to 
authorize the app</b> to access your Stack Exchange identity.  This allows the app to determine
your numeric user ID on the sites in the network where you have accounts.  If you're curious what
 information is retrieved, you can take a look at the <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/types/user">documentation.</a>  
 (It essentially boils down to the public information in your profile.)</p>

<p>All of my browser-based applications utilize <b>client side Javascript</b> - I am never privvy to your
information, personally.  All traffic is between your browser and the Stack Exchange servers.  (The one exception to 
 this is StinkingBadges' use of PHP to grab your reputation graph, which will be changed eventually)  Your access token
 is part of the URL that is not passed to my servers, and cannot be read by any server-side scripts.  Additionally,
 all of this code is open source and available for your review - if it's not already in your browser, please
 visit the relevant StackApps page.</p>

<p>If you wish to manage or revoke this access, you can do so from your profile on any Stack Exchange site.  
Click your name on any SE site (it's next to your reputation) and then click the "apps" link in the upper
right.  From this page you can revoke any access you've granted to any application, including these.</p>

<p>This is still a work in progress - I'm a coder more than a designer, so I apologize for the spartan
 layout and limited style :)</p>
